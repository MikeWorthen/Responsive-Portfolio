                <p id="p1">Hello! I am Mike Worthen and I am a web developer with a passion for making ideas come to life through web content. 
                    I am a veteran of the United States Navy where I served for 6 years as an Intelligence Specialist. I have been married 
                    to my beautiful and amazing wife for the last 5 and half years and we have two children, a boy and a girl, that we adore 
                    and love adventuring with. We recently moved to the state of Utah from North Carolina and we love it so far. It feels nice 
                    to be able to settle in one place now that we are not travelling around the world every 3 years like when I was in the military. 
                    For example, in the last 8 years I have lived in the California, Japan, Virginia, Florida, North Carolina, and now Utah! 
                    (Hopefully for good).</p>
                    <p id="p2">Some of my hobbies include watching and playng baseball, basketball, football, and hockey, hiking, spending time with my family, 
                    and learning and progressing with web development. I also love to camp, exercise, and watch movies, especially war and super 
                    hero movies. Captain America is my favorite super hero because he is the First Avenger and he is very level headed and calculated, 
                    rarely making mistakes. My top three war movies would have to be Lone Survivor, American Sniper, and Saving Private Ryan. </p>
